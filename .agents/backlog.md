# Improvement backlog

Priority queue. `[ ]` = open, `[x]` = shipped (see `changelog.md`).
P0 = correctness/blocker, P1 = high value, P2 = nice-to-have.

> Refreshed 2026-06-02 during the architecture/doc unification pass. Durable
> design rationale now lives in [`docs/unified_architecture.md`](../docs/unified_architecture.md);
> this file tracks only OPEN work. The session-bootstrap helper
> (`python -m tools.session_bootstrap`) reads the OPEN P0 items below.

## P0 — correctness / blocker
- _(none open — full logic suite green: 1205 passed, 10 skipped)_

## P1 — voice / audio (migrated from session_2026-06-01 handoff)
- [ ] **Enable + validate AEC on real hardware** (needs the mic). `config.local.json`
      → `sherpa`: `aec_enabled=true`, start `aec_backend="nlms"`. Calibrate
      `aec_ref_delay_ms` with `tools/echo_probe.py`. Confirm no self-interrupt AND a
      real interrupt still cuts through; then optionally try `aec_backend="dtln"`.
- [ ] **Extend `tools/echo_probe.py`** to print post-AEC **ERLE (dB)** and auto-suggest
      `aec_ref_delay_ms` via cross-correlation (no mic needed to write it).
- [ ] **Validate the Smart Turn v3 endpoint** before enabling:
      `python -m tools.live_session --all --inject --smart-endpoint`; diff ON finals
      vs lexical/acoustic. (Default-off; on in the desktop profile — not yet A/B'd on hardware.)
- [ ] **DTLN follow-ups:** smaller 256/128 size for phone profiles; clock-drift over
      long utterances; consider LiveKit AEC3 if the runtime ever moves to ≥3.11.

## P1 — desktop / 4090 fit
- [ ] Adopt `desktop_gpu_4090` profile on this machine (currently `device=desktop`;
      4090 profile raises `num_ctx` 4096→8192, `num_predict`→512, enables both gates).
- [ ] Measure real end-to-end ASR→LLM→TTS latency on the 4090 (`tools.bench --real`),
      calibrate `tools/specsim/specs.py` against it.
- [ ] Confirm sherpa runs the CUDA provider (config `sherpa.provider="cpu"` today) —
      evaluate GPU ASR/TTS on the 4090 vs auto-tuned CPU threads (32 logical).

## P1 — architecture / cross-platform
- [ ] **Mobile convergence onto the `AgentEvent` contract.** `mobile/lib/assistant.dart`
      is a parallel Dart loop re-deriving core behavior; align the Dart supervisor with
      the Python brain so the contract duplication disappears. See unified doc §10 / §12.
- [ ] **SQLite + sqlite-vec memory backend** for mobile (the `Memory` protocol makes it
      a drop-in for the Postgres adapter). See unified doc §6.

## P2
- [ ] Wire `tools/swarm/harness.py perf --real` into `.github/workflows/perf.yml` parity.

## Shipped this session (2026-06-02)
- [x] Architecture/doc unification: `docs/unified_architecture.md` absorbs ~14 dated
      docs; merged docs banner-linked; stale session logs archived.
- [x] Removed dead `always_on_agent/snapshots.py`; renamed `core/agent.py` private
      `AgentEvent` → `AgentBrainEvent` (collision with the public contract).
- [x] Added `tools/session_bootstrap.py` + CLAUDE.md "Session bootstrap" section.
- [x] Relocated the accidentally-nested `social_media_activities_app/` out of the repo;
      removed the `UsersPaul` junk file; added `.gitignore` guards.
