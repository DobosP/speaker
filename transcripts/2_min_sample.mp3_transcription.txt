 This is a recording made using my new setup on Ubuntu machine. I don't know what's happening. It's recording from the start. Let's test how this recording works. Okay, I can see that the background noise from my music.  on the speaker that I had was there and now it's not there anymore. Let's see how is the weather outside. Outside it's quite cold. It's still winter. The temperature is around 10 degrees Celsius. Celsius and no sun. The no sun is present. It's quite cloudy.  but it's still warm for this time of the year. I will have another 30 seconds test this time. I will try to do a longer conversation to test to see how the  audio recording works on a bigger sample. And thank you for listening to me. I am hoping that Dobo is hearing to you. Dobo is my name and I like speaking a lot, thinking about philosophy, hoping to bring something to the future. This is my normal voice and hopefully you will hear me correctly.
